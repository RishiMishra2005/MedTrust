<h4>MedTrust is a blockchain-based <strong>Decentralized Health Record Management System</strong>. The system focuses on storing the patients' electronic health records efficiently and securely, thus providing the people better access and control of their records, and enabling easy and secure sharing of the records with doctors, hospitals, or insurance companies.</h4>

-----------------------------------------
### Inspiration

* An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a digital version of a patient's medical and treatment histories. There is no authentic report on the number of  patients whose EHRs have been stored so far and an acute lack of security and privacy. Hence, a modern implementation of EHR is required  in India.

* The idea that any person in India can go to any health service provider or pharmacy and have access to his or her health records in an electronic format is essential and can be life-saving in certain situations.
